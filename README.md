# Holistic-Traffic-Management-system
The project had multiple (Proximity sensors embedded on the road to determine the density of traffic waiting on a particular signal and accordingly control the traffic lights. Apart from this the red-light sensors also had a RFID receiver which detected a passing emergency vehicle such as an ambulance and appropriately changed the traffic lights.In addition to this grafana was used to represent data in a dynamic  way.

# OPEN CV
With the boom of artificial intelligence and machine learning, this project can be upgraded to the next level with the integration of computer vision (OpenCV). OpenCV works on image capturing technology and calculating the contour area for every frame and passing it on further. Based on the area of contours we can further manipulate the duration of green signal for subsequent cycles
